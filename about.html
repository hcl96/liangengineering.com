		<p-about>
			Steven Liang obtained his Bachelor Degree in Aerospace Engineering '18 at The Jacobs School of Engineering at University of California, San Diego.
			He is currently pursuing his Masters in Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Controls at the same University.
			As an avid engineer in practice, Steven has been involved in multiple high profile aerospace engineering projects and is currently involved with robotics research as part of his Masters studies. <br><br>
			Steven helped design and construct the Colossus Rocket Engine Test Stand in partnership with NASA, which enables rapid testing of bipropellant liquid rocket engines to research teams and Universities in the West Coast. He later delved into researching rocket propulsion which utilized modern design techniques and state-of-the-art manufacturing methods to reduce production costs of rocket engines by orders of magnitude. During his term as Propulsion Team Lead at SEDS UC San Diego, he lead a team to develop the 2nd-Generation rocket engine, Ignus 2. The engine was successfully hot-fire tested and flight ready.
